##### _Last updated February 2026._

Nameless Sword is a free SRD for playing classic/OSR adventures, essentially a small-scale wargame with exploration procedures and a few rules to handle characters. I hope by sharing ideas we can all find the best settings for our games.

Compatible with most OSR/NSR adventures and on the fly conversion. 

### Main inspirations and sources
* Nameless Sword is the latest iteration of ideas I laid out in [Ensifera](https://dave-craigen.itch.io/ensifera)
* [Chainmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainmail_(game)): dice pool combat
* [Delving Deeper](https://ddo.immersiveink.com/dd.html#): ultimate OSR reference
* [Wolves upon the Coast](https://lukegearing.blot.im/wolves-upon-the-coast): boasts, saves linked to armor
* [Delta](https://deltasdnd.blogspot.com): numbers crunching
* [Press the beast](https://pressthebeast.bearblog.dev/blog/): elegant magic system
* [Mauseritter](https://mausritter.com): hardcore inventory
* [Meatheads](https://halforc.itch.io/meatheads): basis for grappling and chases
* [Cavegirl](https://cavegirlgames.blogspot.com): duel rules

### Conversion
* Divide gold by 10 and make it silver
* HD = Might here. For systems with notation of HP only, take the base HD size and divide HP by it to get the Might.
* See Equipment for armor

That's it. Saves and the like should be obvious enough to also make conversion on the fly.
