# Intro
This system is built on Ensifera (I'm the author), with the addition of the finest rules I designed or found since Ensifera came out. I now think TTRPG systems should be free and open source so that everyone can benefit from the best ideas, and everyone should support financially the authors of well written adventures and settings so they can keep going. 

A classic / OSR system is essentially a small-scale wargame with exploration procedures and a few rules to handle character advancement. This system does just that
.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
