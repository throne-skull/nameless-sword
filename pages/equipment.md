# Hirelings

<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Show</b></summary>
Recruiting hirelings is a downtime action and is always possible unless players have a bad reputation or the settlement is in crisis.
The group must feed and equip the hirelings. Any money given to them disappears, either spent or sent to their families. 

#### Level 0
All hirelings start at level 0. Only Retainers can progress.  
At level 0, a character has 1 HP and 1 ATK. They die when reduced to 0 HP.

#### XP
After an expedition with hireling, calculate the total XP. Divide by the number of PC to determine their individual gain. The retainer of a PC gain half as much as their master. Then, retainers take a half-share of loot.

### Laborers
2 silver each per week, paid up front. Players can hire up to 10 % of a settlement’s population as nonviolent laborers (porters, builders, torchbearers, rowers...).

### Mercenaries
Players can hire up to 1 % of a settlement’s population, rounding up, as mercenaries. Except in large cities or places with heavy traffic, mercenaries can only be hired from the settlement’s listed forces.  
Mercenaries can defend a stronghold, fight other armies, repel monsters, escort caravans and guard camp. They are unwilling to accompany the party into dungeons, ruins and lairs and will not fight to the death.  
They require 1 week paid up-front and a half-share of loot they helped to get.
* 3 silver for a skirmisher. Morale 6, must test it to enter and stay in melee. No armor
* 5 silver for a footman. Morale 7, stats according to gear (typically armor rating 1)
* 10 silver for a veteran footman. Morale 8, stats according to gear (typically armor rating 2)
* 20 silver for a horseman. Morale 9, +1 HP and +1 ATK while mounted, stats according to gear (typically armor rating 2)

### Retainers
Retainers are would-be adventurers inspired by the PCs. They are the only people ready to follow them even in dungeons and other very perilous places. 
Loyalty is kept with fair rewards and glory. Good or bad treatment can have a lasting effect on a retainer’s morale and obediance. If a PC dies, they can promote one of their retainers to the rank of PC.  
Retainers take a half-share of loot.  
* Retainers need 50 xp to reach level 1, at which they gain +1 HP (So 2 HP, 1 ATK, 0 Mana, as a starting character).
* Retainers can go up to level 3.

### Group size
On the overworld, the group can advance with an army if it wishes. In the underworld, it is reasonable to limit the size of the group to 8-12, including retainers.

# Equipment
<details markdown="1">
<summary><b>Show</b></summary>
## Inventory
### Carrying capacity
* You have in quick access (Readied) what is in your hands, and 1 load more at your belt
* You have 4 more loads ready in one action (Worn)
* Everything else is Dead Weight (Packed, 2 actions to recover item). 1 Dead Weight for the first load, and every 2 loads after that. If you should have more than 3 Dead Weight, you are Overloaded. You cannot have more than 6 Dead Weight. Dead Weight is substracted from your Capture save. 

### Overload
* You cannot run or be stealthy;
* you are slow in exploration, travel at -1 speed, and move at half speed in combat;
* some actions are harder or outright impossible;
* enemies gain +1 attack against you.

### Item load
* 1 typical object is 1 load. This represents its size, weight and hindrance. 100 coins make 1 load.
* A Bulky item, larger or heavier is 2 loads. Two-handed weapons, shields...
* Armor takes 2 loads per rank and must be placed in Dead Weight.
* An Unwieldy item is 3 or more loads. You must carry it with both hands. A body is 10 loads.
* Items that can fit in the palm are kept in the pockets. 
* Normal worn clothing and small jewelry aren’t load. Luxurius or winter clothes may be.

### Readied, Worn or Packed
2 loads + the items in your hands are Readied, you can use them on the spot. Other items in your carrying capacity are Worn.
Items in excess of your carrying capacity  are Packed in backpacks and bags. Most items on mounts and porters also are.
In tense situations, it costs 1 action to search and ready a Worn item, and a whole round to search and ready a Packed item.

## Free space
Unless a character explicitly loses them, we assume that they always carry:
* Pockets and up to 2 pocket-sized items (any more takes 1 load),
* A waterskin, and enough water for the day as long as there is drinking water in the surrounding area,
* A small purse that can hold up to 30 coins (any more takes 1 load per 50).

They are not counted as load.

## Depletion
Each significant use marks an X in the resource. This is called depletion.  
A resource has three possible states: sufficient, almost exhausted (X), exhausted (XX). An item is intact, damaged (X) or destroyed (XX).  
1 item = two depletions to destroy.  
1 load of resource = two depletions to exhaust. 
One-use resources are exhausted instantly (e.g. potions).  

## Economy
### Currency
Silver, either coins or hacksilver. 
### Price categories
Basic < Common < 10 < Precious < 25+
Fall back on this to keep shopping quick.
### Resale
Players can resold items at half price.
Treasures can be resold at full price, but you need to find someone rich enough to buy.
Purchase and resale prices may vary according to location and circumstances. 
### Repair
Depleted but not broken items are automatically repaired for free in Downtime as part of the upkeep cost.
Broken items you carried home can be repaired: it costs as much as one price category lower than the original price of the item.

<summary><b>Sacks, supplies & Transport</b></summary>

## Sacks & Transport
1 sack is 10 loads of items. 

| Mounts & Wagons |	Price	| Sacks capacity |
| ----------------|---------|----------------|
| Human porter	|	| 1 |
| Mule, ox	| 20	| 2 |
| Work horse |	40	| 2 |
| Destrier or palfrey	| 100 |	2 |
| Small wagon, requires 2 draft animals |	80 | 8 |
| Medium wagon, requires 4 draft animals	| 120 |	16 |
| Heavy wagon, requires 6 draft animals	| 160 |	24 |

### Mounts
* Mules have good stamina and can thrive on less nutritious pasture than horses.
* Horses are fast enough to escape many monsters. You can even ride a laden horse in an ermegency (escaping from a wandering encounter). However, they need good pasture or rations (1 load per day of feeding) to keep going.
* Destriers don’t fear combat and can be ridden into battle.
* Palfreys can travel at Fast speed without suffering the usual 1d3 fatigues.
* Wagons have no suspensions: travel is slow, rough, and only possible by road. 

## Supplies
You can buy 10 loads of unspecified goods under the same price category and put them in 1 sack. E.g. a sack of common items costs 50 silver and contains 10 loads of common items worth 5 each.
You can equip a hireling porter with 1 sack of a specific category (food, climbing, light, etc.) to simplify the management of large expeditions.

#### Helmet, gambeson
Sacrifice one to cancel a Wound (but the damage stay) before it is rolled or to reduce by 1 the number of Flesh you should lose if you are down to your last HP. _e.g. You should lose 1d6 Flesh, instead you lose 1d6-1 flesh._

#### Shield
When you should lose your last HP and start losing Flesh, sunder your shield to make a Save against Death.
* If you fail, reduce by 1 the number of Flesh you should lose.
* If you succeed, your shield absorbs all remaining damage and you are left with 1 HP but no loss of Flesh.

For NPC: when they should die, their shield is sundered and they get 2-in-6 chance to survive with 1 HP. Treat NPC with AC 6, 4 and 2 as having a shield.

Shields from defeated fighters have a 2-in-6 chance of not being broken.
