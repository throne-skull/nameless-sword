Magic is secret nature.  
The practice of magic consists in extracting patterns of influence (spirits) from this nature in the form of spells.  
A spell is a captive spirit, frozen in a function. You don’t learn it, you own it in your head.  
Each spell exists as an individual entity and cannot be copied, only moved. You could, however, capture two entities with the same effect (same spell) and thus be able to own it twice.

You can prepare as many spells as your Mana, but only one spell per night. Each spell can be cast once, then it needs to be prepared again. If you own twice or more the same spell, each multiple is treated as a separate, individual spell.
* If you wear a witch hat (1 load), you can prepare as many spells as your Mana +1.

There is no limit to the number of spells you can own. To own new spells, you must rely on the Maleficar trait or find them in adventure or through teachers or the skulls of dead mages.
* If you focus near the skull of a freshly dead mage, you have 2-in-6 chance per spell they had to steal the spell before it vanishes in the wild.  

To cast a spell, you must:
* be out of melee range
* have it prepared
* not be overloaded
* speak high, make incantatory gestures
* see the target unless specified otherwise
* have one hand free or holding a catalyst
If you cast a spell without the use of a catalyst, you lose 1 HP.  
Each Dead Weight you carry is substracted from your Mana regarding spell power and duration.

As for now, duration, range and the spell list are based [on this post from Press the Beast](https://pressthebeast.bearblog.dev/nathequest-2026-normal-spell-system-new-new-new/). 

Core info:
> Spells are either instantaneous or last for 10 minutes per caster Mana unless otherwise mentioned. They may effect any valid targets the caster can clearly see.  
>
> Some spells require sigils. These can be drawn in 10 minutes, and allow the spell to last indefinitely. Sigils can be carved, drawn with chalk, ink, blood, etc. If erased or destroyed, the spell will falter. Once a sigil is drawn, that spell cannot be recovered unless the sorcerer ends the spell which may be done psychically at any time.

Conversion from the blog post:
* Caster level = caster Mana
* 1d6 damage = 1 damage


### Mage’s gear (20 silver each)
* Catalyst (1 load): if you cast a spell without it, you suffer 1 damage.
* Mana hat (1 load): conceals your mana emanation. If you cast spells without it, you may attract unwanted attention from other magic-users and creatures seeking mana sources. You can also sacrifice your hat to cast a spell with +1 Mana.
* Arcanic Robe (clothing): if you don’t wear armor, increases your save against Witchcraft by 2.
* Grimoire (1 load): a grimoire can hold all your spell scrolls (otherwise 1 scroll = 1 load).

### Spell scrolls
Anyone can use a spell scroll.  
A spell scroll contains a spell. You can destroy the scroll to cast the spell as if you had +1 Mana (so if you have 0 Mana, you can still cast the spell). Alternatively, the scroll can be sacrificed to own the spell.  
To create a scroll, you need a week of work, one good parchment with special processing (5 silver), and to lose a spell (you don’t own it anymore) as you move it from your skull to the scroll.  

### Magic Items
Holding a magic item allows you to learn its effects, but you also suffer any curse it bears.  

Weapons and armors typically have an enchantment bonus of +1 to +3.
* **Weapon**: +1 ATK against as many creature types as its bonus (giants, dragons...).
* **Armor**: takes 1 less load per bonus. At +3, the armor weight nothing and grants you +1 to your Saves against Capture.
* **Shield**: each time you "sunder" it, it has 3-in-4 chance to only lose 1 point of enchantment instead.

##### Other item types
* **Potion**. One-use. If the label is not clear, you can only learn its effects by using it.
* **Artefact**. Each time you use it, there is 2-in-6 chance it loses its powers after or is destroyed in the process.
* **Talisman**. You need to pay a price each time you use it, or fulfill a specific condition to recharge it.
* **Object of Power**. The most powerful magical items, with durable effects for the bearer. You cannot separate yourself of them willingly (you must at least carry them on your person if you don't equip them; if you would use an item with similar function, you must use this one instead) without succeeding a save against Witchcraft (one attempt per season).
