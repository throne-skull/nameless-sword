# Exploration

### Time, space and movement
An exploration turn lasts around 10 minutes. Most actions take 1 turn, for example:
* Searching a room or a few corpses
* Crossing a room or long hallway for the first time with extreme caution, in fickle light, while mapping

Players choose their exploration speed. Cautious is the default.
* Cautious, inexplored area: 1 turn = 1 room
* Cautious, explored area: 1 turn = 3 rooms
* Fast, inexplored area: 1 turn = 3 rooms
* Fast, explored area: 1 turn = 10 rooms

If you are Slowed (overload, carrying someone in critical condition...), you take double the amount of turns for the same number of rooms.

**Cautious**  
It is assumed that the characters:
* Look all around them (floor, ceiling, walls) as best as they can
* Are watchful of the presence of traps (they notice clues to it if there is any, e.g. small holes in the walls -for gas exhaust)
* Are alert to noises, smells and other sensory markers
* Do not touch anything that seems abnormal
* Are as sneaky as possible

The Referee describes any anomalies, peculiarities or obvious dangers. Once a feature has been described, the way the players interact with it may or may not put them in danger.

**Fast**  
The group makes noise and is unable to spot details and dangers even merely hidden. It has no chance to surprise and is surprised on a 4-in-6 chance. 

### Stealth
Global stealth is abstracted by the chance to surprise (see Encounters). If you gain Surprise or you are already aware of creatures who are not aware of you...
#### Moving silently
As long as the following conditions are met, you can move around undetected without a test.
* They are unaware of your presence (you are undetected and there is no alert).
* You are not overloaded or wearing heavy armor (light and medium are OK).
* You stay in "stealth areas" (tall grass, behind objects, passages where you can’t be seen easily, etc.).

Make an Agility test to move stealthily in an exposed area, but only if it would be possible to pass undetected (you can’t walk in front of guards without being seen). Also test to stay stealthy while risking noise (walking on dry leaves, jumping down, killing someone, etc). If you have to both cross an exposed area and risk noise, the test is Very Hard.  

In the event of an alert, you can’t move in the open or risk noise without being spotted (either seen or heard), and you have to make an Agility test to move unseen even in stealth areas.  
If you don’t move, you can hide.
#### Hiding
If you’re well hidden, a creature must actively Search you to find you, as they would for a trap or secret door. 
#### Stealth deathblow
If you manage to get close enough a target while they are unaware, and you can ensure a killing blow (mitigate armor, size, etc), the victim is slain instantly. Otherwise, you automatically deal 1 damage for each of your attacks (special resistances still apply).  

Attacking an alert target while you are unseen is a normal attack with Surprise rather than a deathblow.

### Light
A single source of light is sufficient to see the coarse features of a typical room, but the details require closer inspection. Each inspection requires a separate light source to be carried out in parallel.  
In the underworld, when players extinguish a source of light, it dies (you need to replace it). _No clever light on/off to escape light attrition_.
* A torch lasts 3 turns and lights well. It does not goes out easily, even in movement or if it is dropped.
* A lantern with a candle lasts 6 turns and lights dimly. It goes out easily, especially with quick movement or if it is dropped (4-in-6 chance).

Underworld denizens are assumed to see well in the dark. Light would alert them, you can only surprise them by coming through a door.

### Doors
Many dungeons doors are stuck and must be forced. They open for monsters, however, and magically close if left as is.

#### Listening
If you check quickly, 2-in-6 chance (Referee roll) of identifying any audible sound. The undead make no noise. If you spend one turn listening, success is guaranteed.
#### Bashing doors
You get a chance to surprise those behind. If the door is defensive, you need to succeed a Vigor test to bash it quickly (it only makes noise, calling an encounter check). If you fail, bashing the door takes 1 turn, makes a lot of noise (2 encounters checks, 1 for time and 1 for noise), and you lose any chance to surprise those behind the door. 
#### Lockpicking
With a lockpick and a successful Finesse test, you open the door in 1 turn. A failure makes you lose 1 turn in vain and depletes your lockpick. Silently picking a lock gives you the advantage of surprise over any creatures in the room.

### Searching
Each character searching for one turn has 2-in-6 chance to spot a trap, treasure or secret door (one success needed for each hidden element) in the room/hallway (or section of it, if the place is very large). While searching, a character is vulnerable and caught by surprise in case of encounter. 
* If players are smart enough to say where and what they expect and guess well, they spot it instantly, no turn wasted.

### Traps
When its conditions are met, a trap triggers with a 2-in-6 chance. Its targets may sometimes get a save against Capture as a last chance to avoid it.

### Illusions
To break an illusion, you must act with conviction. 
* When faced with something passive, strike it powerfully to prove your disbelief (an object, a wall, a phenomenon, etc).
* When faced with danger, let it strike you to prove that you do not believe in its presence.

## Hazards

### Climbing
You cant’ climb overloaded.  
Without plenty of easy handholds or a rope attached to the top, climbing is hard. A success allow you to climb one story. A failure counts as no progress for a turn. Two failures in a row result in a fall halfway to the height that you would have reached on a  success.  
1 Turn...
* Placing an anchor point with pitons
* Studying a route per 10 meters to find out which routes are passable and what the potential dangers are. One climber can rig a route so no-one else has to study it. 
* Climbing 1 story or abseiling 3.

### Jumping
Average distances an adventurer can jump.  
Reduce by half if standing or carrying Dead Weight (if both, halve then halve again). Test Agility to reach up to double the distance.
* Running long jump: 4 meters.
* Running vertical jump: 60 cm.

### Falling
* 2 meters or less: no damage.
* 3 to 6 meters: you lose 1 HP.
* 7 to 12 meters: save against Death. Failure means death. Success: you have 1 HP and a Wound. 
* 13+ meters: death.

Falling while secured by a rope and anchor point: height is based on lenght of the rope from the anchor point. The climber still take damage as above due to shock absorption. 1-in-6 chance that the anchor point will give away, 2-in-6 if climbing on ice or a particularly brittle material.

Falling in water: under 20 meters no damage. Up to 30 meters, lose 1 HP. Beyond, save against Death. The depth of the water must be at least equal to half the height of the fall to not crush yourself at the bottom. 

### Drowning
A character must save against Capture every minute, and drowns if they fail.

# Referee side
## The Grind
Every exploration turn, the Referee draw a card from a 54 classic cards deck with jokers removed.  
If it is a face or ace, something happens:
* ♣ ♠	Encounter
* ♦ ♥	Omen or dungeon event

Each face and ace card should have a specific entry in the dungeon tables.  
Any other card means either nothing happens or you can key specific events to them.  
#### Light
* Every 3 cards, torches are exhausted.
* Every 6 cards, lanterns are exhausted.

#### Noise
If the group is making noise or attracting attention in any way, draw an extra card each time (to see if they attract an encounter), but put it aside, it doesn’t count towards elapsed time and light consumption.
#### Omen or Dungeon Event
Encounter omens (tracks, hairs, distant noises) or progress of a dungeon-specific threat (flooding...).
#### Ongoing effects
Draw as many cards, face-down, as the effect lasts in turns. Make a separate pile from which to draw instead of the main deck. When the face-down pile is depleted, you know the effect is over. This is particularly useful for taking into account the duration of spells.
#### Shuffle
Shuffle all cards when the group transition from wilderness to dungeon or vice versa, and at the end of each session, or when you feel like it.

## Encounters

#### Surprise
In case of unexpected encounter, roll 1d6 per side, with 2-in-6 chance to be surprised for each side. If one side surprises the other, it becomes aware of it first.
If both are surprised, both spot each other at the same time. Neither side has any advantage.  
Surprise can be used to hide, silently evade the threat, start negotiations, overhear, or attack with advantage.  
Adjust the chances of surprise for each side according to circumstantial factors. Some creatures have greater chances of surprise.  
Scouting: any member 1 room or more away from the rest of the party can roll surprise separately from the rest of the group.  
Expecting: if one side has already spotted the other, it automatically gains Surprise.  

#### Distance
* Dungeon: 1 to 4 rooms away, what makes the most sense
* Wilderness: 4d6 x 10 meters  
* Wilderness, surprise: 1d4 x 10 meters  

#### Numbers
Each encounter entry detail how many of the creatures are encountered at once.

### Reaction Roll
Creatures always attack if they have the advantage of surprise. Otherwise if not obvious, roll 1d6 to determine the initial attitude, which is only modified by non-verbal biases such as signs of affiliation by +/- 1.  
After the roll, the way players approach the situation can typically switch the result by 1 rank.  
If the conversation stalls, consider the current rank as “last rank” and apply the consequences.  

|Score	|Creature reaction|
|-------|-----------------|
|1-	|Make a Morale check or choose according to power balance. Failure means flight or submission. Success means immediate attack. |
|2	|Unfavourable. Thin, tense room for negotiation. If last rank, test morale as above.|
|3-4	|Cautious. If last rank, disengages without violence if possible, or gives a final warning if it is the PCs who should leave. If they don’t, test morale as in 1.|
|5-6	|Neutral, open to a fair exchange. If last rank, makes a final take-it-or-leave-it offer. If PCs don’t take it and don’t leave, disengage/warning as above. If the PCs accept a particularly good deal for the creatures, potentially helpful as below. |
|7+	|Cordial, helpful. Start of a relationship (business, friendship, alliance).|

Each creature has its own Disposition which affects the way they approach the situation. Most things are hungry and/or greedy. Combine with the result, e.g. Cautiously hungry.

### Actions
* Parley: if both sides decide to talk, roleplay the negotiation and use the way players approach the situation to adjust the reaction of NPCs.
* Chase: if one side decides to flee, the other may pursue. 
* Combat: if one side attacks or maneuvers, start Combat. 

### Chase
* Organized retreat: use the lowest speed of the group.
* To each their own: individual results.

Substract the Speed of the pursuers to the Speed of the evaders. The remaining value is the chance in 6 to escape for the fleeing party, modified by:
* +1 for dropping something of interest for pursuers (food, treasure...), if they care
* +1 for each obstacle used favoring the evaders (corners, traps, oil, caltrops, off-road trails...)

If you fail, you are caught and the enemy can perform a round of action against you as if it had surprise. You may flee again after if possible.

* The chance in 6 to escape is aIso the number of rooms the evaders can pass through before being caught on a failure, or the number of rooms they put between them and pursuers on a success.  
* Fleeing is done at Fast speed as for exploration movement.  
* If your pursuer doesn’t know where you are, it will search at reandom for a few rooms.
