Camp (1 day turn)
After 2 day turns of activity, you need to rest for 1 day turn. If you don’t, until you rest you get 1 fatigue at the start of each day turn.
Requirements
To benefit from camp, you need to be protected from extreme temperatures and inclement weather. 
Thirst and hunger
If you have not eaten a ration worth of food today, mark 1 hunger in your inventory, +1 per previous day of ongoing hunger. If you haven’t been drinking, mark 1 thirst.
Fire
You can combine 2 loads / 4 depletions worth of torches into a campfire lasting 1 day turn as long as someone remains near it. It casts light and heat out to 3 spaces.
Safety
By default there is 2-in-6 chance of encounter by day turn spent in camp in dangerous wilderness or in dungeon. A hidden or fortified location may change these odds.
If something happens during rest, determine at random who is on watch at the time.
Having to flee, fight, or alter the camp ruins the rest.
Successful camp
After each day turn spent resting, each character can erase 1 fatigue. After a rest, but  only once per day, you can equip your spells.
Full day of rest
If you rest for three consecutive day turns (24 hours), you recover 1 HP.

Downtime (1 week)
By default, downtime lasts one week and only take place in a secure location. You can chain downtime but have to pay upkeep each time.
Pay upkeep
Depleted but not broken items are repaired for free
Each character gets 1 downtime action
The party hears the rumors of the week
Each character fully rest
Upkeep
Upkeep represents wealth spent on festivities and leisure, but also gifts to maintain good relationships and generosity towards the local nobility, community, and your retainers.
With an upkeep of 5 or below, you sleep in a local’s home.
At 6 or more, you can afford the inn or to sleep at the manor of the lord if you earned respect.
You can pay more than your upkeep requires, to increase your lifestyle.
If you fail to pay your upkeep, you must test the morale of each retainer: those who fail the test leave your service. You must also test Vigor and suffer a fatigue at the end of the week on failure, or even a disease if you live in the wilds. Finally, failing to pay upkeep places you in debt to the community where you live or to its lord.
You can forfeit a Level if you want, to reduce your upkeep. You remove 1 level and the benefits of your last Feat as you lose confidence and competence. You can’t recover a forfeited Feat, you must perform a new one.
