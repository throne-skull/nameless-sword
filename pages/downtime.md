By default, downtime lasts one week and only take place in a secure location. You can chain downtime but have to pay upkeep each time.
* Pay upkeep
* Depleted but not broken items are repaired for free
* Each character gets 1 downtime action
* The party hears the rumors of the week
* Each character fully rest

### Upkeep
Your level * 2 in silver.

Upkeep represents wealth spent on festivities and leisure, but also gifts to maintain good relationships and generosity towards the local nobility, community, and your retainers.
* With an upkeep of 5 or below, you sleep in a local’s home.
* At 6 or more, you can afford the inn or to sleep at the manor of the lord if you earned respect.

You can pay more than your upkeep requires, to increase your lifestyle.

If you fail to pay your upkeep, you must test the morale of each retainer: those who fail the test leave your service. You must also test Vigor and suffer a fatigue at the end of the week on failure, or even a disease if you live in the wilds. Finally, failing to pay upkeep places you in debt to the community where you live or to its lord.

You can forfeit a Level if you want, to reduce your upkeep. You remove 1 level and the benefits of your last boast as you lose confidence and competence. You can’t recover a forfeited boast, you must perform a new one.

### Depleted and broken items
* Remove depletion from items not broken.
* Broken items you carried home despite their useless load can be repaired for one price category lower than their original price (see Equipment). 

### Downtime Actions
Each character gets 1 action per downtime.

#### Carousing
[I use Carousing by Luke Gearing](https://lukegearing.blot.im/d100-carousing), _Except die * 10 silver instead of 100 gold_.

#### Training
* New languages, auxiliary skills (cooking, riding giant lizards...), ... The Referee sets how many downtime actions it takes to learn the thing, keep track of its progression.
* Characteristic: you need a teacher. Pay them your level * 5 silver, choose one characteristic and roll 1d20 at the end of the week. If the result is higher than the trained characteristic, it improves by 1. Otherwise you suck, try again next week.
* Spells: you need to find a mage who has duplicate spells or spells they don't use. They can typically sell them to you for 100 silver per spell.

#### Recruit hirelings
You spread the word that you want to recruit people, you meet them and you brief them.
#### Other
Typically, a long-term project that takes too long to play, and which is left to progress in the background.  
As for learning, the Referee sets how many downtime actions it takes, and if any special requirement must be met to advance the project.
### Rumors
The party may hear some rumors.
### Full Rest
Effects only apply at the end of Downtime.
* You heal 1 Wound per Downtime.
* You recover all HP and Flesh, and erase all fatigues.
* You will probably be able to delete several conditions (hunger, thirst...)
* You can prepare one spell per night, so up to 7 if you haven't used them while in downtime and you have the required Mana level.
