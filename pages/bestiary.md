### Statblock
* Disposition. Description. Size and speed if relevant. Instincts, skills, lures, if relevant.
* Armor Rating (AR), Hit points (HP), Attacks (ATK). Same as for characters.
* Movement Speed (MV): number of spaces the creature can move.
* Might (MGT): a creature typically has as many HP and attacks per turn as its Might. 
* Traits: resistances, vulnerabilities, if any abilities (spellcasting and Mana go there). 
* Treasure: or valuable organic material that can be harvested, if not obvious.

### Saves
Saves for creatures are the same as for player characters. If their monstrous nature could help:
* Fast monsters add 2 to their Capture save
* Tough monsters add 2 to their Death save
* Magical monsters add 3 to their Witchcraft save

### Traits
* Weak to X: If you attack them with X, you get +1 attack.
* Resists X: +2 armor/save against X.
* Immune to mundane weapons: Traditionally, some creatures can only be harmed by magic weapons or spells. In this game, they can also be harmed by silver weapons (four times the price). Everyone knows this. Silver weapons break after a single depletion and suffer depletion on a roll of 6 on the attack die if used against foes not vulnerable to silver.
* [Supernatural HP](https://necropraxis.com/2018/09/11/supernatural-magnitude/): when you deal damage to this creature, you have only 1-in-6 chance to actually deal damage, otherwise the damage is cancelled.

### Darkvision
Most underworld creatures can perceive in the dark through weird senses.

### Movement speed
Substract armor rating from it. Monsters with natural armor do not substract it from their speed.

|MV| TYPE|
|:--:|:-----:|
|3 |Siege engine|
|6 |Most humanoids|
|7 |Assassin-type monster|
|8 |Giant, chariot|
|10 |Horse/mounted, wolf, bear, slow flying|
|12 |Flying or extremely fast|
|14 |Fast flying|

## Building creatures
A creature typically has as many HP and attacks per turn as its Might. To set the Might of a creature, ask yourself how many basic soldiers would be needed to kill it. 
* You can use Might x2 as a budget to distribute between HP and Attacks to create a disproportionate monster, for example a Might 4 monster with 6 HP and 2 attacks (total 8).
* You can either count Mana in the HP/ATK budget, or add as a free bonus as much Mana as half their Might, rounded up.
* Humans have less Might than monsters. Most humans have 1 HP and 1 ATK. To budget HP/ATK/MANA for stand-out NPC, use Might+2 instead of Might x2 so that a Might 3 human NPC is equal to a Level 3 player character. 

### Power level
A monster’s power level is its Might x2. The power level of a PC is its level +2. This game has been playtested up to level 11; 10 is the intended maximum. A level 10 PC is «as strong» as a Might 6 monster.

### Natural armor
* 0: weak, _e.g. cattle, human, zombie, giant centipede_.
* 1: sturdy or evasive beast, _e.g. bear, lion, crocodile, giant spider_.
* 2: plates, scales, or evanescent, _e.g. giant beetle, dragon, elemental, ooze_.
* 3: extremely hard or superhuman speed, _e.g. ancient dragon, storm giant, kraken, vampire_.

### Natural weapons
* Bite, horns: +1d to start or contest a grapple ; or +1 damage on a crit if great size.
* Claws: as shortsword or arming sword
