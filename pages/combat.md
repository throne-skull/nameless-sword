# Round

### Surprise
With surprise you can perform one round of actions unanswered and you have +1 chance to hit.

### Priority
At the start of each round, roll 1d6 to determine the priority. 1-3 PCs, 4-6 opponents (context might change the odds). The phases are resolved simultaneously for each group, by priority within each phase.  
Side A Opening then side B Opening, side A Melee then side B Melee, etc.  
Members of the same side can act in any order they wish between themselves. Actions are resolved as they are declared.  
A fataly wounded fighter can still finish their action or attacks in the same phase (simultaneous action, if you kill a fighter, they may still kill you in the same phase).  

### Phases
Each phase lists the possible actions within it. 
* 0  Priority roll
* 1  Opening Phase
    - Ranged attacks
    - Movement
    - Cast quick spells 
* 2  Melee Phase
    - Melee attacks
* 3  Ritual Phase
    - Cast slow spells
* 4  End of round
    - Any check for Morale or Saves
    - Note the remaining duration of effects

## Actions
You have two actions per round, but can act only once per phase.

You cannot trade a phase-specific action for an action specific to another phase, e.g. Melee for another Movement.

However, you can do a miscellaneous action instead of an Opening or Melee action.
#### Miscellaneous actions
* Ready a worn item, take something, use a readied item (e.g. potion)
* ~~Protect an adjacent ally: any attacks they suffer this round are redirected to you~~
* First aid
* Other similar actions.

#### Forgo all other actions to:
* Reload a crossbow
* Retreat from melee
* Search and ready a packed item

### Spells
To cast spells, you must be out of melee.  
You must declare a spell in the Opening phase. Make a Capture Save: on a success you cast the spell now. On failure you cast it in ritual phase. If you are hit in-between, you lose your action and the spell fails (but is not lost, you can try to cast it again later).

### Movement
The side without priority declares its movement, and the side with priority can interrupt or hinder with its own movement.
#### Space
1 space = 2 meters in the game world. For theater of the mind, that’s all you need.   
With a battlemap and ruler, 1 space = 2cm.   
If you aren’t used to metric, you may use:  
1 space = 5 feet in the game world.  
With a map and ruler, 1 space = 1’’.  
#### Speed
Your speed is equal to your Capture save. It is the number of spaces you can cover in one round with a move action.  
You swim and climb at half speed. Rough terrain also halve your speed. If your are Slow, halve your base speed. Minimum speed is 1.  
#### Moving
You can move up to your speed. You may pass through allies if there is enough space, but not enemies.  
If you start the Opening phase outside of melee range, you may move up to twice your speed.  You may try to evade the combat (see Encounters, Chase).   
If you are in melee range, you can only move closer to the enemy unless you disengage and retreat.  
To disengage and retreat from melee, you have to forgo all other actions this round and can move up to your speed away from the melee.   

## Attacks

### Melee attacks

1. You must allocate your attacks as equally as possible between targets within reach. Then proceed in order for each target:
2. The chance to hit per attack die is 8 minus target armor. Apply any other modifiers.
3. Roll 1d12 per attack and count successes. A result of 12 is always an automatic failure.
4. Each successful attack inflicts 1 damage.  

The Referee rolls attacks for the enemies, PCs for themselves and their allies.  

Attacks are simultaneous unless one side:
* Charged this round
* Attacks with Surprise
* Attacks on the flank
* Attacks on the rear

In this case, the side with advantage has First Strike: your attacks are resolved first in the melee phase, and enemies you kill are eliminated immediately, before the end of the phase (they lose their action and can’t strike back).

You can forgo all your attacks in the melee phase to:
* Gain +1 armor this round
* Rally troops: +2 chance to succeed morale check for hirelings, max once per round and only if you rally from the heat of battle.

#### Modifiers
* **Surprise**: first strike, +1 chance to hit
* **Flanking**: first strike, +1 chance to hit
* **Rear attack**: first strike, +1 ATK
* **Death Blow**: you can attack a prone enemy only if there is no standing enemy within your reach. Your attacks hit automatically.
* **Prone**: you are vulnerable to death blows. You can attack from the ground, but only up to 1 ATK and you have -1 chance to hit. You cannot get back up the same round you got prone. Adjacent opponents may try to prevent you from getting up if they have priority. Getting back up uses 2 of your movement. If enemies control the space where you need to get up, you need to use grappling to push them ?
* **Improvised weapon**: -1 chance to hit.
* **Disarmed**: -1 chance to hit. Others have +1 ATK against you.
* **Advantage** (e.g. high ground): +1 chance to hit.
* **Narrow surroundings**: fighting in the doorway, for example, could reduce the number of attacks that fighters can make, as well as the number of fighters who can attack.
* **Blinded**: unable to attack.
* **Mounted**: NPCs get +1 Might (+1 HP, +1 attack). PCs get +1 attack and can choose to sacrifice the mount to absorb 1 damage for them.

### Ranged attacks
You can only make one ranged attack per round, unless specified otherwise by the weapon or an ability.
* You must be out of melee range and your ammo must be Readied (in hand or belt) ?
* Unless you use a bow, you must allocate attacks to the same target.  
* If you don't aim for the nearest target, you have -1 chance to hit. If there is several ranks of enemies and you don't shoot from high ground, you can only aim up to the second rank, others are screened by the ranks in front of them.

Throw
* Each time you throw a weapon, deplete it. 
* You cannot chain ranged and melee attacks unless you have a throwing weapon in one hand and a melee weapon in the other.  
* If you have a throwing weapon, you can throw it while charging (handaxe, javelin).   

#### Target with shield  
Against ranged attacks, a shield is worth 3 armor instead of 1. 
#### Target engaged in melee  
The closest ally is hit instead if you get a 10+, they take 1 damage.   

### Criticals
Crits apply both to PCs and NPCs. Critical hits do not affect creatures with Supernatural HP.
A result of 1 on an attack die is a Critical. It deals 1 damage and a Wound.  
* If you wear a helmet, you can sacrifice it to cancel the Wound or the damage, but not both, and you must do so before the Wound is rolled. 

### Attacking to subdue
Declare before attacks. -1 chance to hit. If you reduce the target to exactly 0 HP (no excessive damage), you subdue them. Otherwise they die as usual.

### Grappling / Movement ?
You can attempt a gambit instead of any other action, but only once per round.  
This is how you resolve combat maneuvers such as disarming, tripping, pushing, grappling, subduing an enemy, etc.  
You describe the effect you wish to achieve, and the Referee gives you the odds of success on 1d6, taking into account the difference in size, level, capability and circumstances. Typically 2-in-6 if inferior, 3-in-6 if equal and 4-in-6 if superior.   
The risks involved in case of failure are proportional to the desired effect unless you can secure an advantage before.  
Several characters can join forces for a single gambit. Enemies can also attempt gambits.  

_Based on Meatheads:_
Grapplers roll as many d6 as their number of attacks against one another, with the highest total controlling the grapple.

If winning a grapple, record the result. Controlling the grapple means you can pin them, throw them, etc. Grappled foes break out by attempting to roll higher than the result that initially beat them. Each round grappled foes must check Morale. Additionally, you may use your full round to tighten the grip and deal 1 damage, +1 per previous round doing this. Or you can attack them while they can only try to defend themselves. 

If you fail to grapple your opponent, you must choose:
* The attacks of the foe allocated to you hit automatically;
* Be restrained, they gain control of the grapple;
* Be thrown to the ground and receive a temporary Wound.

Daggers can be used to attack during grapple.

When you charge, you can give up your First Strike to attempt a grapple instead (it doesn't work against spears). Otherwise moving eats your action en prevents a grapple. 

To fighters not in the grapple, you are both treated as prone and can suffer deathblows. ?

Several people can join force in a grapple against the same target, add up together all their d6 (as many as their attacks). 

### Vanquish
An NPC who reaches 0 HP is slain at the end of the current phase. They can still act in this phase (simultaneous action).   
Hits are opportunistic and aim for the highest lethality. If you want to shoot them in the eye, it’s just a normal attack and unless you reduce them to 0 HP, you don’t achieve this outcome.  
#### Vulnerable target  
If you manage to get close enough a target while they are unaware, and you can ensure a killing blow (mitigate armor, size, etc), the victim is slain instantly. Otherwise, you automatically deal 1 damage for each of your attacks (special resistances still apply).  

### Formal Duel
As with rock-paper-scissors, duelists must simultaneously declare their technique for the round between Parry, Assault and Feint. The winner gets a bonus for the round.
* Parry beats Assault : +2 armor
* Assault beats Feint : +1 Attack
* Feint beats Parry : +2 chance to hit
* Same: both get the bonus as if they had won.

Exceptionally, during a duel, NPCs can sunder their shield as a PC would.

## Morale
PCs never test Morale, but most NPCs do, allies and enemies. Unless they are exceptionally disciplined, insensitive or fanatical, they must check morale when facing a trigger.  
Common morale triggers include:
* Loss of one-third numerical strength
* Death, retreat or surrender of a leader
* Being ambushed
* Horrific situation or enemy
* Retreating or surrendering allies

#### Morale check
Roll 1d12 by group. A result equal to or less than your chances is a success. The chances of success depend on the combatants’ military experience. 
* Weak: 5. Untrained troops.
* Average: 7. Trained troops.
* Strong: 9. Veteran and elite troops. 

Circumstances may modify the chances of success by up to +/- 2.  
A failure results in organized retreat. If they cannot retreat, they will try to surrender. If surrender is not an option either (enemies are not taking prisoners), they will fight to the death.  
Rolling a 12 results in disorganized retreat or surrender.  
On a success, morale holds.  

### End of Combat
A fight lasts at least 10 minutes (1 exploration turn), the time it takes to fight, regroup, breathe, patch wounds, etc.

# Health
## Hit Points (HP)
A damage is something that could kill someone. Each damage removes 1 HP. If you have more than 1 HP, you can survive things that would kill a lesser being. Damage is mostly cosmetic for a character until they lose all their HP, at which point their life is in danger.
#### Save against death
If a character’s HP is reduced to 0, they must make a save against death: if they fail, they die, otherwise they survive by risking a permanent wound (see Wounds).

If alive, the character can continue to act normally thanks to adrenaline, but they are in critical condition.

#### Critical condition
The character is bleeding out and dies at the end of 2 rounds following the one in which they entered the critical condition, unless stabilised. If they suffer further damage while at 0 HP, they die.
* **First aid**: Finesse test (Very hard if you try on yourself). Success: patient stabilised. Failure: a turn spent for nothing. Multiple attempts possible, but only 1 per round. Deplete bandages to reduce difficulty (auto success if you help someone else, normal test if you try on yourself). 
* **Stabilized**: The character is no longer dying, but still at 0 HP. If they suffer further damage while at 0 HP, they die.
* **Death**: When your character dies, create a new one or take control of a hireling. They quickly join the party.
* **Nemesis**: A creature that kills a PC immediately gains +1 Might (+1 HP, +1 attack).

## Wounds
Wounds caused by critical hits are temporary and last until a week of full rest. 

If you must roll a Wound caused by saving against Death at 0 HP: roll 1d20. On 1-10, it's a temporary wound. On 11-20, it's a permanent wound (substract 10 to know which one on the Wound table). 

Whatever the wound type, it fills one inventory slot until a week of full rest.

If you would get twice the same wound, instead you lose some non-essential bits of yourself (an ear, a finger, a toe, the tip of the nose, teeth, bit of lips, big scar on the face or the skull where hair won't regrow, etc).

If an enemy should suffer a Wound not suitable for an NPC (e.g. -1 to tests of characteristic): characters have +1 chance to hit an enemy for each such Wound they have. 

For each permanent wound you have, you can attract an additional retainer. 

| 1d10 | Wound |
|-----|-------|
| 1 | Shoulder: -1 to bashing chance|
| 2| Arm: -2 to grapple results|
|3| Knee: -2 movement spaces (also apply as penalty in Capture for chases)|
|4| Leg: -1 chance to succeed tests of Agility|
|5| Guts: -1 chance to succeed tests of Vigor|
|6| Head: -1 chance to succeed tests of Finesse|
|7| Back: fills one inventory slot (in addition to the one of the Wound itself until healed) |
|8| Chest: -1 to Saves|
|9| Eye: -1 chance to hit with ranged attacks|
|10| Hand: you cannot use this hand for anything|

### Recovery
* 1 HP per full day of rest
* All HP after a week of downtime
* 1 Wound per week of full rest


# Battles

### Units
* A Figure is an individual fighter. Figures mainly move together as Ranks in Units.    Player Characters, leaders and creatures differing strongly from their rank are Unique figures.  
* A Rank can include up to 5 figures. Rank describes the position of a given figure in a Unit: front, middle or rear. When a rank has disparate gear, use the one most represented in that rank if equal, or the most inferior if unequal.   
* A Unit is made of figures close enough to be cohesive. A Unit can be made of up to 3 stacked Ranks.   

If you want a rank to be larger than 5,  instead start an adjacent rank as a new Unit parallel to the fisrt.  
One light source is typically enough for 1 rank (it doesn’t allow close inspection).  

### Battle Lines
A Battle Line is formed when two Units meet and the front Ranks clash in melee. Move figures closer at the beginning of melee, so that their bases touch.
#### Reach
As long as there is at least 1 figure in a rank, you can’t directly attack the rank behind it.

Spear-equipped fighters can attack the enemy’s front from the middle rank of their own unit, but cannot attack the enemy’s middle from the front (since the enemy’s front blocks).

A figure typically have within reach the 3 closest frontal opponents. If you must allocate an inequal number of attacks to figures in a rank, those in the middle suffer more attacks (select randomly if necessary).

#### Attack resolution
When allocating attacks, there are only two types of agents: Unique figures, and the ranks of normal figures.

Refer to Reach to know how to allocate attacks. Regarding attack allocation and resolution, normal figures of one rank are treated as a single entity.

For each agent, resolve the attacks targeting Unique figures first. Then resolve attacks targeting normal figures. 

Damage from attacks targeting normal figures is not allocated target by target, but directly to the rank as a whole. Each time the rank suffer as much damage as the HP of one of its figures, remove one figure from it and consolidate the rank toward the middle.

If a rank is destroyed with excess damage, the excess is dealt to the rank behind it, even if it has better armor. _The corpse falls on the next rank, opening up vulnerabilities._ 
* This method is faster, but if you want, you can compare individually whether attacks with excessive damage would really hit the armor of the next rank.

#### Resolution order, melee phase
* First strike attacks, remove the dead
* Priority side attacks then other side attacks
* Remove the dead

#### Tides of battle
At the end of a round, for each Battle Line with groups of equal strength, the group that has inflicted the most hits pushes the other back one space and advances one space. Otherwise, the larger group or creatures pushes the other. 

### Casualties
If you want less extreme casualties, each removed figure has 3-in-6 chance to be wounded but alive (they were left for dead in the heat of battle).

### Morale
Per Unit. A routed Unit may attempt a morale check to re-enter combat, only if one round has passed without suffering losses or morale trigger.

### Range in spaces
Melee range : 1  
Dagger throw: 2  
Spear throw: 5  
Handaxe throw: 6  
Javelin throw: 7  
Shortbow: 12  
Crossbow: 24  
Sling: 30  
Longbow: 36  

#### Volley
If you reach a critical mass proportional to the target, double the effective range of ranged weapons.

### Movement
Movement mostly takes place at the Unit scale, but you may scale down to Ranks or figures according to circumstances. 

Cycling between ranks in close formation: swapping places with a figure from another rank takes 1 movement action for each (coordination). They must be adjacent and  make a Capture Save. If one fails, both lose their remaining action for the round but they can swap places. If both fail, both lose their remaning actions for the round and they can't swap places. ~~If one fails while in melee, he suffers +1 ATK from enemies.~~

If you move over an obstacle or difficult terrain, you may have to test Agility.

#### Retreat
If a creature in melee retreats due to a Morale test, it must pass a Save against Capture or take 1 damage.

### Tactical
#### Leaders
If an Unit has one individual with a greater Might than all other individuals in this Unit, they are the leader of this Unit. A leader increases the morale of the Unit by 1.
#### Duels between leaders
Leaders in the front rank can challenge each other to a duel (resolved with the duel rules), played instead of the clash of the rest of their Unit (each side is watchful of the other to prevent intervention or interrumption of the duel). Refusing a duel results in a morale check for your unit. The death of a leader is also a morale trigger and the check must be made with -2 chances of success after a duel death.
#### War banner
If you have at least a full unit (15 figures), one figure may carry a war banner. Doing so allow the unit to automatically succeed it’s first morale check and increase morale by 1. Losing the war banner triggers a morale check.
#### Cavalry charge
Foot soldiers under cavalry charge must test Morale or break formation, in which case cavalry fighters get +1 attack this round.

An Unit of foot soldiers who succeed with a result of 3 or less can defend with braced spears, in wich case they gain +1 attack against the charge.
#### Cover
Fortifications and other defensive advantages may offer +1 Armor or even more. 
#### Maneuver
Check morale to execute a maneuver. Complex movement of Units count as maneuvers.
* Shieldwall (maneuver): unit moves at half-speed, but is immune to most missiles.
