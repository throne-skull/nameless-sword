# Travel

Day turns
A day is divided into 3 turns: morning, afternoon, and night.
After 2 day turns of activity, you need to rest for 1 day turn. If you don’t, until you rest you get 1 fatigue at the start of each day turn.
The Referee determines the weather at random, based on the region’s climate and the season.
At the end of each day, the Referee updates time records, with special attention to ongoing effects, and the party’s need to eat and rest.
Turn procedure
Action
The group chooses one action per turn.
Navigation
Decide on a course (a road or cardinal direction). If the group does not have a constant landmark (road, river), the Referee determines whether the group gets lost.
Odds of getting lost
Condition	Odds
Road/Landmark	None
Open terrain	1-in-6
Forest / Mountain	2-in-6
Swamp, Jungle	3-in-6
Fog / Rain / Snow	4-in-6
Dark night	5-in-6

Events
The Referee uses a regional random table of events and encounters to determine what happens during this turn.
Description
The Referee describes the environment, event (if any) and things of interest.
Turn actions
Moving forward
Choose movement. If you walk for 2+ turns in a day, test Vigor: you mark 1 fatigue on failure. A mount prevents this.
Hunting
This can vary considerably depending on the setting and local environment, but by default the group has 1-in-6 chance of finding 2d6 fresh meat rations.
Fresh meat rations that are not eaten within a day of the kill require a Vigor test to avoid food poisoning. The difficulty increases by 1 rank per day after the kill. 
Eating raw meat implies poisoning and/or parasites. Preserving meat by salting or smoking takes 1 month.
Foraging
1-6 chance of finding 1d6 rations of roots, berries and edible plants. 
1-in-6 chance of finding 1 load of rare plants (magical, medicinal, special).
Increase the chance according to the local flora.
Fishing
If there is somewhere to fish, 3-in-6 chance to find 1d6 rations. 
Exploring
Detailed exploration of a place: dungeon, village, lair... It may not take the whole turn.
Resting
Set-up camp and rest (see Rest).

Weather
When you are exposed to severe weather for 1 turn without the means to protect yourself, check Vigor. If you fail, you suffer 1 fatigue or get sick according to severity.
Distance
Distance and progress are typically measured in hexagons, not visible to players and managed by the Referee. You can consider a “hex” to be an unit of distance even without using a hexgrid: all you have to do is determine how many hexes away a destination is.
Navigation
Visibility
In general you can get an idea of the neighbouring hex by getting close to it. 
From a good vantage point, you may see into adjacent hexes and gather information about relief, biome, major rivers and some other landmarks. 
Weather conditions can impair visibility.
Mountains are visible from 4 hexes away. 
Getting lost
Deviation is of 1 hex face from intended direction. The Referee rolls 1d6: on an even number, the shift is clockwise, on an odd number, counter-clockwise. On 1 or 6, the group veers by 2 faces instead of one.
As long as the group remains lost, continue to add deviation at each phase.
A group ceases to be lost when it recognises where it is or resumes navigation by landmark.


Movement
The base speed is 0 while hiking on road, meaning 1 hex per day turn of travel. 
Speed
Speed	Rate
+2	3 hex per turn
+1	2 hex per turn
Base (0)	1 hex per turn
-1	2 turns per hex
-2	3 turns per hex
-3	4 turns per hex
-4	5 turns per hex

Modifiers
Condition	Modifier
Road	None
Off road (trail, wilderness)	-1 speed
Difficult terrain	-1 speed
Bad weather	-1 speed
Group is Slow	-1 speed

Caravan
If you travel with a wagon or large group of non military people, your speed can’t be more than 0.
Forced march (+1 speed)
Take 1 fatigue. 
Mounts (choose)
Normal: not faster, but you don’t tire as much.
Fast: +1 speed. The mount suffers 1d3 Fatigues.
To death: +2 speed. Roll 1d6 per turn: the horse  suffers as much Fatigues and dies on 5-6. After the ride, roll another d6: on 5-6, the horse goes lame.


### Camp (1 day turn)
After 2 day turns of activity, you need to rest for 1 day turn. If you don’t, until you rest you get 1 fatigue at the start of each day turn.
Requirements
To benefit from camp, you need to be protected from extreme temperatures and inclement weather. 
Thirst and hunger
If you have not eaten a ration worth of food today, mark 1 hunger in your inventory, +1 per previous day of ongoing hunger. If you haven’t been drinking, mark 1 thirst.
Fire
You can combine 2 loads / 4 depletions worth of torches into a campfire lasting 1 day turn as long as someone remains near it. It casts light and heat out to 3 spaces.
Safety
By default there is 2-in-6 chance of encounter by day turn spent in camp in dangerous wilderness or in dungeon. A hidden or fortified location may change these odds.
If something happens during rest, determine at random who is on watch at the time.
Having to flee, fight, or alter the camp ruins the rest.
Successful camp
After each day turn spent resting, each character can erase 1 fatigue. After a rest, but  only once per day, you can equip your spells.
Full day of rest
If you rest for three consecutive day turns (24 hours), you recover 1 HP.

### Escape and chase
#### Wilderness
A failure indicates evaders are caught within the same day turn, and a success that they put 1 day turn between them and pursuers. Either way, evaders are likely to get lost.
If pursuers can’t track them (4-in-6 they can), it ends the pursuit; if pursuers can track them and are willing to continue, they do but can’t catch the evaders unless the evaders loose their 1 turn of advance.
Ongoing pursuit
Creatures are likely to pursue for as many navigation decisions/turns as the Might of their strongest individual. 


# Conditions 

Conditions
Each condition takes 1 inventory load. 
Fatigue
Takes 1 precious inventory space. See Rest to remove fatigues.
If you should suffer a Fatigue but your inventory is full, you can drop an item to prevent being Overloaded.
Diseases
Initial test against Vigor to resist. If you resist, you are safe. 
If you fail, you suffer the disease in phase 1. Every Interval (daily, weekly), make a Vigor test again. If you succeed, the condition drops by 1 phase and is cured if this reduces it to 0. If you fail, it advances to the next phase of severity.
A disease takes as much inventory load as its current phase. If the phase becomes equal to your Vigor, you die.
If the character is in good circumstances or benefits from an appropriate remedy, they can directly reduce 1 phase or more.
Hunger
Ending a day without eating enough inflicts 1 ‘hunger’, +1 for each previous day of starvation. Each day spent eating properly erases 1 hunger.
Thirst
A character marks 1 ‘thirst’ for each day without drinking. At the end of the 3rd day, and each consecutive day spent without drinking, they must make a test against death and perish if they fail.

Toxins
The character suffers the first effects of the toxin: paralysis, unconsciousness, agony, hallucinations, etc. Then, they make a save against death: on success, it lasts a round, a few moments. On failure, it lasts 10 minutes at the end of which they have to make another save against death. If successful, the character recovers and survives, albeit with only 1 HP. If they fail, the character dies or suffers the worst effects of the poison.
Some poisons are so violent that they automatically result in death.
Toxin applied to a weapon
Weapons covered in poison only discharge their poison once, on a successful attack, and then the poison must be reapplied.
Obtaining poison
Poisons are rare and difficult to prepare and store. Applying poison to a weapon is considered disloyal and odious, and severely repressed in conflicts between humans.
Killing a creature with poison renders it unfit for consumption.
Asphyxia
Suffocation
After 90 seconds of holding your breath.
For each additional action performed or each interval of time elapsed while holding your breath, make a Vigor test: if you fail, you can no longer hold your breath.
If you can’t breath, you fall unconsciouss the next round and die the one after.
Drowning
A drowned person can be rescued within a maximum of 10 minutes, and is entitled to a save against death if they receive first aid. If successful, the character coughs up water and comes back to life. Otherwise, they are dead.
